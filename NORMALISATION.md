Normalization is mathematically irrelevant for graph topology when using pure cosine similarity, because cosine similarity is inherently scale-invariant by definition.

From the search results, we can see that cosine similarity has a key property: **"it is unaffected by the magnitude or length of the vectors being compared"** and **"for any positive constant a and vector V, the vectors V and aV are maximally similar."**

## The Real Purpose of the Normalization Flag

However, there are still valid reasons why you might want the normalization toggle:

### 1. **Downstream Spectral Analysis**

While the graph topology (adjacency structure) remains identical, the **stored vectors in ArrowSpace** are different:

- **Normalized**: All vectors have unit norm, which affects later spectral computations (Rayleigh quotients, synthetic λ indices)
- **Unnormalized**: Vectors retain original magnitudes, so spectral analysis sees magnitude information


### 2. **Future Extensibility**

The flag enables future similarity functions that ARE magnitude-sensitive, such as:

```rust
// Hybrid similarity that incorporates magnitude
let magnitude_ratio = (norm_i / norm_j).min(norm_j / norm_i);
let magnitude_penalty = (-((norm_i / norm_j).ln().abs())).exp();
let hybrid_sim = alpha * cosine_sim + beta * magnitude_penalty;
```


### 3. **Memory and Numerical Stability**

- **Normalized vectors** are more numerically stable for certain operations
- **Unnormalized vectors** preserve original data fidelity


## Correct Test Strategy

Your tests should verify that:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_normalization_preserves_graph_topology_but_changes_stored_data() {
    let items = vec![
        vec![1.0, 0.0],
        vec![10.0, 0.0],  // Same direction, different magnitude
        vec![0.0, 1.0],
    ];

    let params_norm = GraphParams { eps: 0.5, k: 2, p: 2.0, sigma: None, normalise: true };
    let params_raw  = GraphParams { eps: 0.5, k: 2, p: 2.0, sigma: None, normalise: false };

    let gl_norm = build_laplacian_matrix(items.clone(), &params_norm);
    let gl_raw  = build_laplacian_matrix(items.clone(), &params_raw);

    // Graph topology should be identical (cosine similarity is scale-invariant)
    assert!(mat_eq(&gl_norm.matrix, &gl_raw.matrix, 1e-12));
    
    // But the ArrowSpace should store different vector magnitudes for downstream use
    // This would be tested at the ArrowSpace level, not the Laplacian level
}
```


## Conclusion

You've identified a key architectural insight: **the normalization flag is primarily for controlling data storage and downstream spectral analysis, not for changing graph topology when using cosine-based similarities**. The current implementation is mathematically correct—cosine similarity naturally provides scale-invariance regardless of whether vectors are pre-normalized or not.

If you want magnitude-sensitive graph topology, you'd need to implement a different similarity function entirely, not just toggle normalization with cosine similarity.
